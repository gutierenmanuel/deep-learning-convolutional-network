# Deep Learning Exercise

This repository contains a deep learning model implemented with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying images of dogs and cats. The model has been trained using a comprehensive dataset and is expected to generalize well for new images of dogs and cats.

The model is not in the models folder because it has a weight greater than 100mb but inside is the code I used to generate it.
